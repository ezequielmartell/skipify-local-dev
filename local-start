# Services
docker compose up # -d if you want to detach from the terminal, leave it off if you want to monitor the logs.
# also useful switches: --build to force a rebuild of the images, --force-recreate to recreate containers even if their configuration and image haven't changed.

# Backend
source venv/bin/activate && python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000

# Celery Worker and Beat
source venv/bin/activate && celery -A django_aws worker --loglevel=info -B

# Frontend
npm run dev
# Note: You may need to run `npm install` first if you haven't already set up the frontend dependencies.

# TODO: add commands that run these for you in new terminal windows or something 

# possible option is to edit tasks.json in the root of the project to add a new task that runs this script in a new terminal window
# and then bind a key to it in keybindings.json

make sure venv is setup through VSCODE so that your terminals use the right interpreter by default.
